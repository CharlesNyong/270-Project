# 270-Project

An online contact manager that includes basic features such as

- Add contact
- Delete contact
- Edit contact
- View contact

You can think of this application as a phonebook. The targeted audience for this app are those who don't possess a mobile device or those who find the need to have an online phonebook. 

Potential features

- Messaging contacts (emojis included)
- Making calls 

Note: this was a project done for one of my university courses, but i plan on enhancing it. The enhancement plan will be to include the         potential features listed above.
